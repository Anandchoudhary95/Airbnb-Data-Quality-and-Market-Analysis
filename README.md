**Project Title: Airbnb Data Quality and Market Analysis**

**1. Introduction**

This project explores Airbnb listing data obtained from the Inside Airbnb platform.
The work focuses on two important areas:

Data Quality Assessment – verifying whether the dataset is reliable for analysis.

Market Analysis – extracting insights that help understand pricing, availability, demand, and supply across neighbourhoods and room types.

The aim is to approach the dataset as a business stakeholder would, answering real questions relevant to travellers, hosts, or market managers.
